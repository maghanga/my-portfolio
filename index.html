                            <p>I am a 22 year old software development student at Moringa school with an aim of becoming a full-stack web developer in the near future. I have recently acquired a Digital Marketing certificate from The Africa Digital Media Institute and I am a former Political Science and Public Administration student at The University of Nairobi. I was previously freelancing as an SEO expert and media buyer and interned at Digital 4 Africa; a digital marketing agency in Nairobi and I co-own an event organising company called Element Kenya. I am a solution driven person and I strongly feel that a programming course would equip me with the necessary skills to achieve my goals. I love solving common problems, planning and attending social events and I absolutely love  fashion and football, perhaps I might even consider them as industries I would like to contribute to as a programmer.</p>
